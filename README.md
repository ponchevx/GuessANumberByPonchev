"Guess a Number game project" - 
In this mini-game project, the computer chooses a random number from 1 to 100, and the player has to guess it in limited tries (10). If the player guesses the number in the allowed attempts then level 2 is unlocked, where the range is 1 to 200 and the attempts are 20. If they manage to guess it again then the game is completed.
